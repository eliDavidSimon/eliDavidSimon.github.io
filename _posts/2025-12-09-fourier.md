# Introduction

![Description](.assets/Fourier_series_for_square_wave.gif)

The Fourier series is a way for us to approximate a function as a sum of Sines and Cosines. As you can see in visual above, we add up a bunch of wave functions and they get closer to the original function. In fact, if we add up an infinity ammount of these Sines and Cosines, we get the function!!! This is really cool conceptually but what does this mean mathmatically?

Fourier declares that any function $f(t)$ can be expressed as a sum of waves such that:

$$f(t)=\frac{a_0}{2}+ \sum^{\infty}_{n=1}a_n \sin(nt)+\sum^{\infty}_{n=1}b_n \cos(nt)$$

# Derivation

This is fine and dandy, however, there is one major issue! We don't know what any of the constants mean. The constants $a_0$, $a_n$, and $b_n$ coule be equal to anything for all we know. For this, we are going to use some intregral magic to isolate every constant as an equation. I am going to just write out the intergrals that we will be using but watch this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijQaTAT3kOg) if you want a more detailed explanation of the deriviation. It breaks down the topic I am covering very well, and I really like this guy's videos. These are the intergrals we will be referencing:

$$\int^{2\pi}_0 \cos(mt)\cos(nt)dt = 

\begin{cases}

\pi & m = n\\\

0 & m\ne n

\end{cases}$$

$$\int^{2\pi}_0 \sin(mt)\sin(nt)dt =

\begin{cases}

\pi & m = n\\

0 & m\ne n

\end{cases}$$

$$\int^{2\pi}_0 \sin(mt)\cos(nt)=0 $$

For reference, $m$ is a positive whole number. Now lets break down the case of $\int^{2\pi}_0 f(t)cos(mt)dt$:

1. We start with the first term, $\frac{a_0}{2}$:
   
   $\frac{a_0}{2}\int^{2\pi}_0 \cos(mt)dt=0$
   
   You can work this out on your own, it's not a particularly hard intergral.

2. Term two, $\sum^{\infty}_{n=1}a_n\sin(nt)$:
   
   We know that $\int^{2\pi}_0 \cos(mt)\sin(nt)dt=0$ and since this term is just a sumation of sin waves, every single one of sines goes to $0$.  

3. Term three, $\sum^{\infty}_{n=1}b_n\cos(nt)$:
   
   We are working with $\int^{2\pi}_0 \cos(mt)\cos(nt)dt$. Now, almost every term in the sum will go to $0$. Except for our special case of $m=n$.

Putting this all together , we get:

$$\int^{2\pi}_0 f(t) \cos(mt)dt= b_m \int^{2\pi}_0 \cos^2(mt)dt$$

$$= b_m \pi$$

$$\therefore b_m = \frac{1}{\pi} \int^{2\pi}_0 f(t) \cos(mt)dt$$

# Important formulas

You can derive $a_n$ with $\int^{2\pi}_0 f(t) \sin(mt)dt$, and $a_0$ with $\int^{2\pi}_0 f(t)dt$.

All together, we have the formulas:

$$a_0=\frac{1}{\pi} \int^{2\pi}_0 f(t)dt$$

$$a_n= \frac{1}{\pi}\int^{2\pi}_0 f(t) \sin(nt)dt$$

$$b_n=\frac{1}{\pi} \int^{2\pi}_0 f(t) \cos(nt)dt$$
